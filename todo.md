# TODO

## Ask peter

- Reading nvidia cuda guide
  - We can use that
  - Also use academic papers
  - LLU decompusition on cuda
- How much time on optimising java and c
  - Spend time on it
- How much time on add and multiply
  - Dont use too much on add
  - Optimise multiply
- Why java faster then c?
- Makefile or python?
- Flops how to measuere
  - Just count
  - Check from computer
- How to debug cuda
- What time to measure
  - Sum of copy
  - Compute time
  - Sum of compute + copy
  - On cpu compute only multiply
